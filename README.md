# Gamification-App
I have implemented a gamification application, which allows users to earn "tokens", "badges", and a ranking system based on solving quests. Quests can be proposed by anyone, provided they have enough "tokens"/"badges"/"ranking" to reward potential winners/participants. The main way to earn "tokens" is by solving quests.
